## Q1. Explain the thread life cycle.
Whenever a thread is created to perform its task, it goes through different states between the time it is created and when it completes.
During its life cycle, a thread can move to the following different states:

- **New:** When a thread object is created, It is in a New state
- **Runnable:** The start() method brings the new thread to the runnable state
- **Running:** When the thread is scheduled and is being executed by the processor, it is in the running state
- **Non-Runnable:** If the thread is sleeping, waiting for a resource that is being used by another thread, or blocked because of an I/O request, it is in a Non-Runnable state
- **Dead:** When all the operations have been completed, The thread will terminate and go into the dead state
