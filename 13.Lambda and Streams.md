## Q1. What is a Functional Interface?
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It can have any number of default or static methods, but it must have only one abstract method. This single abstract method is known as the functional method or the signature method.

Functional interfaces are used in Java 8 and above to support lambda expressions and method references, which are key features of functional programming in Java.

Here's an example of a functional interface in Java: 

```

@FunctionalInterface 
public interface MyFunctionalInterface { 
	int doSomething(int a, int b); 
}

```
