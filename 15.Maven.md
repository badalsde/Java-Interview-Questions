## Q1. What XML file is used in Maven to build your application?
Maven relies on a single, central configuration file named pom.xml to orchestrate the entire build process for your project.  Think of it as the project's blueprint, containing all the critical information Maven needs to bring your application to life.  Within this file, you'll define various aspects such as:

- Project Identification: This section specifies the project's name, group ID, and version.
- Dependencies: All the external libraries your project requires to function. Maven will then automatically download and manage these dependencies for you.
- Build Plugins: These are specialized tools that Maven can leverage to perform specific tasks during the build process. Common examples include compiling Java code, packaging your application into a distributable format (like a JAR file), or running unit tests. The pom.xml file defines which plugins to use and how to configure them for your project's needs.
- Build Instructions: This section outlines the sequence of steps Maven should follow to build your project. It essentially dictates how to compile your source code, handle resources, and package the final application.

By meticulously crafting the pom.xml file, you provide Maven with a clear roadmap for building your application. This not only streamlines the development process but also ensures consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.
