  Date & Time API Conceptual Questions
</h1>


## Q1. What is the Date and Time API feature in Java 8?
The Date/Time API contains plenty of resources organized under java.time package for manipulating date and time in an efficient way using simple intuitive methods. Also, the Date/Time API classes have utility methods to carry out common tasks such as minus, format, plus, parse, etc.

Some of the resources provided by the Date/Time API are:

- **LocalDate:** It is an immutable, thread-safe class whose instances represent date without the time and time-zone components.
- **LocalTime:** It is an immutable class that is thread-safe. Its instances represent time without date and time-zone.
- **LocalDateTime:** It is an immutable and thread-safe class whose instances represent date and time without the time-zone.
- **ZonedDateTime:** It is an immutable and thread-safe class whose instances represent date and time along with the time zone.
- **Period:** It is an amount of time that is date-based and available in Java.time package. This class simply models the amount of time in terms of days, months, and years.
- **ChronoUnit:** It is an immutable and final enum that is thread-safe, is a standard set of date-time units. It allows unit-based access to manipulate date/time/date-time.


 ## Q2. What are the differences between the old and new Date Time API of Java 8?
- In the old API, Date was mutable, but in Java 8, all date and time classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, or LocalDateTime are Immutable.
- In the old API, SimpleDateFormat was not thread-safe, but in Java 8, Formatter is thread-safe.
- In the old Date and Calendar API, the Year starts with 1900, Months start with 0, which is corrected in Java 8; here, the numbers make more sense.

## Q3. How do you get a month and year from a Date object in Java?
You can convert a Date to a Calendar and then use the get() method with various fields to get the month, year, day of the week, and other date particulars.

**Example:**

```

import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;
public class GetMonthYear {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Date date = new Date();
		Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
		calendar.setTime(date);
		int year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);
		int month = calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH) + 1; 
		System.out.println("Year: " + year);
		System.out.println("Month: " + month);
	}
}

```

**Output:**

Year: 2024<br>
Month: 5


## Q4. Which class represents a specific moment in time in the UTC time zone?
- In Java, the class that represents a specific moment in time in the UTC time zone is java.time.Instant. An Instant represents a point on the timeline, typically accurate to nanoseconds, which can be used to represent a specific moment in time. It is independent of any time zone or calendar, and is measured relative to the Java epoch of January 1, 1970 UTC.
- To create an Instant object representing the current moment in time, you can use the Instant.now() method. 

Here is an example: 

Instant now = Instant.now();

You can also create an Instant object from a specific date-time using the atZone() method and passing the UTC time-zone as an argument. Here is an example: 

```

LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2023, Month.APRIL, 18, 12, 0);
ZoneId utcZone = ZoneId.of("UTC");
Instant instant = dateTime.atZone(utcZone).toInstant();

```

This creates an Instant object representing the date-time April 18, 2023, 12:00 in the UTC time zone.


## Q5. How can you parse a String into a LocalDateTime object in Java?
To parse a String into a LocalDateTime object in Java, you can use the LocalDateTime.parse() method. This method can parse a String representation of a date and time into a LocalDateTime object, using the default format of yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.

Here is an example of how to parse a String into a LocalDateTime object:

```

String dateString = "2023-04-18T15:30:00";
	LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(dateString);
This code parses the String "2023-04-18T15:30:00" into a LocalDateTime object named dateTime.

```

If the String is in a different format than the default format, you can provide a custom format string to the DateTimeFormatter class and use that to parse the String into a LocalDateTime object. Here is an example:

```

String dateString = "18/04/2023 3:30 PM";
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy h:mm a");
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(dateString, formatter);

```

This code parses the String "18/04/2023 3:30 PM" using a custom format string of "dd/MM/yyyy h:mm a" and creates a LocalDateTime object named dateTime. 


## Q6. What is the difference between the LocalDateTime and ZonedDateTime classes?
In Java, LocalDateTime and ZonedDateTime are both classes that represent date and time, but they have some important differences.

**LocalDateTime** is a class that represents a date and time without any time zone information. It represents a date and time, such as "2023-04-18T12:30:00", but does not have any information about the time zone or offset from UTC. It is used to represent a local date and time, such as a timestamp in a log file, or a scheduled event that is local to a specific location.
 
**ZonedDateTime**, on the other hand, is a class that represents a date and time in a specific time zone. It includes information about the time zone or offset from UTC, such as "2023-04-18T12:30:00+01:00[Europe/London]". It is used to represent a date and time in a specific time zone, such as an appointment that takes place in a different time zone than the one where the code is running.

Here is an example of how to create a LocalDateTime and a ZonedDateTime object:

```

LocalDateTime localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2023, 4, 18, 12, 30);
ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(localDateTime, ZoneId.of("Europe/London"));

```

In this example, we create a LocalDateTime object representing the date and time "2023-04-18T12:30:00", and then create a ZonedDateTime object representing the same date and time in the time zone "Europe/London". The ZonedDateTime object includes information about the time zone offset, which in this case is "+01:00". 


## Q7. What is the Period class in Java?
- The **Period** class represents a period of time between two dates or date times. It can be used to represent durations in years, months, and days.
- The **Period** class is used to calculate the difference between two dates or date-times, and represents the difference in terms of years, months, and days. For example, you can use a Period to represent the difference between two dates, such as the number of days between a birthday and today's date.
 

Here is an example of how to create a Period object:

```

LocalDate startDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
LocalDate endDate = LocalDate.of(2023, 1, 1);
Period period = Period.between(startDate, endDate);
System.out.println(period.getYears() + " years " + period.getMonths() + " months " + period.getDays() + " days");

```
