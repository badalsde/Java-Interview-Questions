## Q1. What are the differences between String and StringBuffer?
| String | StringBuffer |
|--------|--------------|
| The String class is immutable. | The StringBuffer class is mutable. |
| String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates a new instance. | StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate. |
| String class overrides the equals() method of Object class. So you can compare the contents of two strings by the equals() method. | The StringBuffer class doesn't override the equals() method of the Object class. |
| String class is slower while performing concatenation operations. | StringBuffer class is faster while performing concatenation operations. |
| String class uses String constant pool. | StringBuffer uses Heap memory. |


## Q2. Among StringBuffer and String, if performance is the main constraint, then which one would be preferred, and why?
